### Project Report


I begin with the project management tool, Trello, I used a 
starter board to save time and modified it to the client brief 
and content. This standardised the beginning of projects, saving 
time and adding quality.  

Information architecture and Information Design 
were major consideration in the project. Aligning this 
with the client’s goals, I use techniques such as a site-map 
to plan these objectives. 

I version controlled the setting up of the local environment 
with Git then I committed this to GitHub. Local development 
environment chosen was Docker, it’s economical use of 
computing resources, portability, ease of replication and
distribution made it my top choice. 
The Docker Compose file can with one command in the CLI can 
set up all the requirements for a local WordPress site. This 
will help future developers, whom could take up the 
development of this site. The documentation for 
the project can be found in the repository, so my method 
can be replicated.

After reviewing hosting services I chose AWS as it was 
the most economical and can easily be expanded if required 
in the future by the client. I used WP Pusher plugin for 
continuous integration. I designed the child theme to be reusable,
so I did not hard code the content to into the theme, and the styling
can be easily changed to suit another client. 

This project was challenging for me as choices are not my strong suit. I 
persevered and learnt a great deal. Using putty to connect to an AWS instance 
to install apps was very enjoyable. In the future I look forward to learning 
more about servers, version control and Docker. I believe I have only begun 
to see the smallest piece of their potential.
